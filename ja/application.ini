It has features like per-project permissions, milestones, custom fields, email notifications, and more. Traq is written in PHP and is very easy to use.<br><br>Features:<ul><li>Manage multiple projects: When you have multiple projects in progress, it can be difficult to keep track of the progress and manage them. This is where Traq comes in handy. Traq is a tool that helps you manage your projects more efficiently and easily. You can use this software to organize your work and plan ahead, as well as track the progress of each project.<li>Milestones / Sprints: If you're running a development team, things are even harder. You have to juggle between several ongoing projects, fix bugs and create new features while constantly managing deadlines. It can be difficult for a team lead to keep everyone in the loop with what's going on with their projects — it takes up too much time and drains the brain power from your people. Milestones or Sprints are the secret ingredient for any development team. They provide clarity and focus about what has been done so far and what is still remaining as well as what may require more attention.<li>Powerful permission system: Traq includes a robust permissions system that allows for administrators to configure users and team members with granular permissions on a per-project and per-group basis. This makes it easy to ensure that only the appropriate users have access to sensitive project data.<li>Custom Fields: Do you need more information for reported issues and feature requests? Traq allows you to create custom fields to track whatever information you need for your tickets, features and tasks. This way, you can have all the data you need in one place, and it will be easy to find and reference when you need it.</ul>

_installer_smarty_description=Smarty is an application template system.
_installer_smarty_authordescription=Smarty is a template engine for PHP. More specifically, it facilitates a managable way to separate application logic and content from its presentation. This is best described in a situation where the application programmer and the template designer play different roles, or in most cases are not the same person. For example, let's say you are creating a web page that is displaying a newspaper article. The article headline, tagline, author and body are content elements, they contain no information about how they will be presented. They are passed into Smarty by the application, then the template designer edits the templates and uses a combination of HTML tags and template tags to format the presentation of these elements (HTML tables, background colors, font sizes, style sheets, etc.) One day the programmer needs to change the way the article content is retrieved (a change in application logic.) This change does not affect the template designer, the content will still arrive in the template exactly the same. Likewise, if the template designer wants to completely redesign the templates, this requires no changes to the application logic. Therefore, the programmer can make changes to the application logic without the need to restructure templates, and the template designer can make changes to templates without breaking application logic.

_installer_zendframework_description=Zend Framework is an open source application framework. Zend Framework was initially released in 2006.
_installer_zendframework_authordescription=Zend Framework 2 is an open source framework for developing web applications and services using PHP 5.3+. Zend Framework 2 uses 100% object-oriented code and utilises most of the new features of PHP 5.3, namely namespaces, late static binding, lambda functions and closures.<br><br>Zend Framework 2 evolved from Zend Framework 1, a successful PHP framework with over 15 million downloads.<br><br>The component structure of Zend Framework 2 is unique; each component is designed with few dependencies on other components. ZF2 follows the SOLID object oriented design principle. This loosely coupled architecture allows developers to use whichever components they want. We call this a "use-at-will" design. We support Pyrus and Composer as installation and dependency tracking mechanisms for the framework as a whole and for each component, further enhancing this design.<br><br>We use PHPUnit to test our code and Travis CI as a Continuous Integration service.<br><br>While they can be used separately, Zend Framework 2 components in the standard library form a powerful and extensible web application framework when combined. Also, it offers a robust, high performance MVC implementation, a database abstraction that is simple to use, and a forms component that implements HTML5 form rendering, validation, and filtering so that developers can consolidate all of these operations using one easy-to-use, object oriented interface. Other components, such as Zend\Authentication and Zend\Permissions\Acl, provide user authentication and authorization against all common credential stores.<br><br>Still others, with the ZendService namespace, implement client libraries to simply access the most popular web services available. Whatever your application needs are, you're likely to find a Zend Framework 2 component that can be used to dramatically reduce development time with a thoroughly tested foundation.<br><br>The principal sponsor of the project 'Zend Framework 2' is Zend Technologies, but many companies have contributed components or significant features to the framework. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and StrikeIron have partnered with Zend to provide interfaces to web services and other technologies they wish to make available to Zend Framework 2 developers.<br><br>Zend Framework 2 could not deliver and support all of these features without the help of the vibrant Zend Framework 2 community. Community members, including contributors, make themselves available on mailing lists, IRC channels and other forums. Whatever question you have about Zend Framework 2, the community is always available to address it.
